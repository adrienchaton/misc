**check_torchaudio_biquad.py** = pointing an issue with torchaudio when low-pass filtering short audio chunks or when chaining filters in a higher-order biquad cascade

**separation_ops.py** = using some DCT implementations for computing a transient envelope, using a median-filtering implementation for HPSS, implementing the extended HPSS with harmonic/percussive/residual separation

**attention_binder.py** = sample code for "Deciphering antibody affinity maturation with language models and weakly supervised learning"
